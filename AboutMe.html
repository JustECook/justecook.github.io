                    <p>Programming was an interest that quickly turned into a blazing inferno within. As the days progressed, I went from learning how to center &lt;divs&gt; to building interactive web applications. I spend time by acquainting myself with source documentation and following up with coding sessions. Up to this point, I have earned certifications in <span class = "fontChange">HTML</span>, <span class = "fontChange">CSS</span>, and <span class = "fontChange">JavaScript</span> . I know this is just the tip of the iceberg, but I am looking to be a part of an amazing team to advance my skillset in a professional capacity.</p>
